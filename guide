Steps for Wireframing and Designing Using Figma
    1. Setting Up Your Figma Workspace
        Create an account: Sign up on Figma's website or log in to your existing account. ✔
        New project: Open a new file or project for your web application. ✔
        Set up a canvas: Choose the appropriate frame size for your web design (e.g., Desktop: 1440px width). ✔
    2. Research and Inspiration
        Competitive analysis: Research similar web applications to gather design ideas.
        Inspiration platforms: Use Dribbble, Behance, or Pinterest for design inspiration.
        User personas: Refer to user profiles to tailor the design.
    3. Define a Design System
        Colors: Choose primary, secondary, and accent colors.
        Typography: Select font families and sizes. Use Google Fonts or a licensed typeface.
        Icons: Decide on a consistent icon set (e.g., Material Icons or FontAwesome).
        Components: Define reusable components like buttons, inputs, and cards.
    4. Create Wireframes
        Low-fidelity wireframes:
        Use basic shapes to sketch the layout of the web pages (no detailed visuals).
        Represent elements like headers, footers, buttons, and sections with placeholders.
        Focus on the placement of elements and user flow.
        Tools in Figma:
        Use the Rectangle, Line, and Text tools to create placeholder shapes.
        Create frames for each screen (e.g., Home Page, About, Contact).
        Iterate: Gather feedback from stakeholders or users and refine the wireframes.
    5. High-Fidelity Design
        Start with the home page:
        Add colors, typography, and icons.
        Replace placeholders with actual content (e.g., images, text).
        Design other pages:
        Maintain consistency by reusing components.
        Ensure a logical flow between pages.
        Interactive components:
        Add hover effects or transitions for buttons and links.
        Prototyping in Figma:
        Link pages together to create an interactive prototype.
        Use the Prototype tab to set interactions and transitions.
    6. Collaboration and Feedback
        Invite collaborators: Share the Figma file with your team or stakeholders for comments.
        Gather feedback: Use Figma's commenting feature to discuss changes.
        Revise designs: Iterate based on feedback to refine the design.
    7. Export Assets
        Export images/icons: Use the Export feature to save assets in formats like PNG or SVG.
        Style guide: Document your design system, including typography, colors, and components, for developers.
